	<p>URL.fish is a tool that allows you to safely store and share sensitive information. Pick a URL, set a lifetime, optionally choose a password and provide the information you need to send. Why? For example: you want to e-mail a password to someone, but don't want to risk someone else reading the mail later on. When you send the url.fish link, the content is burned after reading.</p>

	<br>

	<p>For added security you are able to set a password. In this case, you could send the link and give a hint (like: the password is the name of your cat). Furthermore, sensitive information is never stored for a long time. You set a lifetime - with a default value of 1 hour - after which the content is permanently destroyed.</p>
